/**
 * @brief This class precalculates targets (vector of route handles) we should
 *        route to for some set of PrefixSelectorRoutes.
 *
 * Sometimes we want to route to multiple clusters in one request.
 * This happens if routing prefix contains some '*'. Most common cases are
 * /star/star/ and /region/star/. On the other hand different clusters can have
 * same OperationSelectorRoutes and we don't want to route to same
 * OperationSelectorRoute twice.
 *
 * Before to achieve this we iterated through all clusters that match
 * given routing prefix and built a set of unique OperationSelectorRoutes
 * on each request. This class precalculates these sets for some routing prefix.
 *
 * To use this class one should:
 * 1) create RoutePolicyMap with PrefixSelectorRoutes for all clusters that
 *    match the routing prefix e.g. for /star/star/ these will be all clusters.
 *    Order is important: targets for corresponding cluster will be in same
 *    order as in clusters vector passed to constructor. So local clusters
 *    should be at the beggining of vector.
 * 2) use getTargetsForKey to get precalculated vector of targets.
 *    Complexity is O(min(longest key prefix in config, key length))
